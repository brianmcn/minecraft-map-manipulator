command tutorial series

https://www.reddit.com/r/Lorgon111/comments/4k9ysb/learning_command_blocks_tutorial_series_playlist/

possibly complete different order, start with data get, execute if, say, summon, ...
could do stuff like OnGround:0b/1b, sheep Sheared:0b,Color:0b ... Pos[x,y,z], ...
/execute if entity @e[type=sheep,nbt={Color:8b}] run say hi
small program ideas:
 - eventually quick-and-dirty version of look-teleporter
 - arrow to death point


 general topic-area list
  - setup (see prev series)
  - coordinates (F3 debug screen, xyz, facing rotations, ~~~, ^^^, /setblock, /teleport)
  - entities (/summon, /kill, Tags:[], /tag, /data get entity, /data merge entity, wiki)
  - selectors
  - scoreboard (ent-value pairs, sidebar display, selector test)
  - /execute (sender&location; if, unless, as, at, offset, align, store-result)
  - functions (datapack mechanics, subroutine call control flow behavior and sender-location behavior)
  - repeating command block
  - minecraft:tick loop, time delays
  - JSON text, /tellraw, clickable signs
  - advancements (e.g. test biome)
  - blocks, blockstates & nbt []{}, and /data get block, data merge block, replaceitem


===================
GENERAL PROGRAMMING
===================
apparently no trampolines needed, functions can recurse forever?

think about skylinerw's "else feature"
before a 'switch', set a global flag, condition each branch on the flag, and first instruction of each called branch function unsets the flag
it's a transaction, yes? safe?
annoying that caller and callee have to coordinate, but seems simple and workable?

Note: what is behavior if #base:group calls child1:run which disables child1/child2?
answer: if fully-enabled order is {base,child1,child2}, if child1 calls "disable child2" then 
	(1) child2 still runs this tick and 
	(2) there is a noticeable latency at disable-time, suggesting enable/disable are "heavy"

can we get arrays now by reading/writing? no because paths (e.g. Pos[2]) are still hardcoded...
can have arrays using e.g. array of structure blocks in the world and poking their PosX nbt data or something.

can pose armor stand angles dynamically now, e.g. 3 player axes control 3 pose angles could be fun...
    // first manually merge in some pose data [0.1f,0.1f,0.1f]
    execute store result entity @e[type=armor_stand,limit=1] Pose.LeftArm[0] float 8.0 run data get entity @p Pos[0] 1.0

Things to test in snapshot

    TODO verify "at @e" will loop, that is, perform the chained command for each entity
    same for 'as'
    but not for 'if/unless'

    understand data packs, how to turn off e.g. vanilla advancements/crafting

	cool trick to see if you're in the top-half of an oak_slab block (note that dx,dy,dz selectors test against entity hitbox, not your exact coords)
	/execute at @s if block ~ ~ ~ minecraft:oak_slab[type=bottom] align y offset ~ ~0.75 ~ run say @s[distance=..0.25]

=========
E&T ideas
=========
think about survival waypoints idea...
wubbi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCJRTd7Otq8 has a nice one
basic idea:
 - have a room with lots of clickable signs (go to waypoint N)
 - player can add own signs for names if desired
 - spawn egg or whatnot to place new waypoint (crafting/found materials?), will have AS with particles or whatnot, will store coords in scoreboard in fixed (non-entity?) slots (WayX01, WayY01, ... WayX99...)
 - when player stays in particles for more than 3s or whatever, brings to tp room
 - could 'delete' waypoint by having e.g. WayYnn==-1 to mark as 'unused', and clickable sign to 'forget' it? hm, but how delete the entity there... i guess it could delete self after check if exist based on scores

Unlocking recipes, maybe make a tech tree, and finding dungeons give ingredients to unlock portions of tree?
Like previous season, but with choice rather than linear (craft a knowledge book to 'choose')
possible things to need to learn (from previous) include: Furnace, Bed, Anvil, I. Armor, Bow, D. Armor, Bucket, Shield, D. Pick
others: enchant table, brewing stand (nether chest item to get recipe?), iron pick, all hoes, stone tools, 

Figure out custom terrain to use

QFE? meed master list of all items, then curate for obtainable; rest should be straighforward?
also the qfe could be an existing teleporter once i unlock first teleporter; first visit to QFE room could actually start the qfe game?

cut the tutorial for good
ignore custom modes, and item chests in initial version

bugs & ideas from top of old file


feature ideas:
 x beacon at spawn
 x randomly put people on 1/2/3/4 teams
 - 'blind' covered play (on_newcard, on_got_squareNM, what else? need UI to turn on & off (data pack enabling?) and maybe UI to uncover card at end?)
 - use achievement toasts rather than chat for got-item notifications?
 - enable-able datapacks mean e.g. alternate loot tables could be turned on, etc?
 - custom configs done as separate data packs? out-of-band changes/extensions?
    - on-start/on-respawn is one type of simple customization that maybe could be in datapack
    - lockout, 'blind-covered', other bingo-game mechanics updates are more baked in, hm...
 - call out 'sniper bingo' (score exactly 5)
 - 20-no-bingo? mkg points out you can 'lose' after e.g. 45 mins, only downside... could play "20-no-bingo-else-blackout" on the subreddit maybe
 - 'visually specify a plan', e.g. in lobby before start, mark items on card (for bingo, alt, 20-no-bingo, ...)?
      - what is gui to interact? how would it appear on the card? make any sense for multiplayer? ...
new items:
 x arrow as bone alternative
 x detector rail and activator rails as rail alternative
 x redstone torch as easier repeater?
 x water/lava bucket? (would interact with tool-like gameplay a little, but not bad) is very easy... cauldron alternatives? lava yes, water no

architecture

helper functions
 x PRNG
 x make new card (clone art, setup checker command blocks)
 x finalize prior game (clear inv, feed/heal, tp all to lobby, ...)
 x make new seeded card
 x make new random card
 x ensure card updated (player holding map at spawn)
 x begin a game (lots of logic here...)
 x check for bingo (5-in-a-row logic)
 - team-got-an-item (announce, add score, check for win/lockout)
 x various 'win' announcements/fireworks/scoreboard
 x worldborder timekeeper logic (compute actual seconds)
 x find spawn point based on seed (maybe different logic/implementation from now? yes, binary search a list of larger choices...)
 x compute lockout goal

blocks
 x art assets
 - ?lobby? (or code that write it?)
 - 'branding' on the map (bingo by lorgon, bDia)
 - history/books/donations/etc

ongoing per-tick code
 x updating game time when game in progress (seconds on scoreboard, MM:SS on statusbar)
 x check for players who drop map when game in progress (kill map, tag player, invoke TP sequence)
 x check for players with no more maps to give more
 x check for anyone with a trigger home score (to tp back to lobby)
 x check for on-respawn when game in progress (test for live player with death count, run on-respawn code, reset deaths)
 x check for 25-mins passed when game in progress

setup
 - gamerules
 x scoreboard objectives created
 x constants initialized
 - ?build lobby?
 x any permanent entities

discarded ideas:
 
 - new item: water bottle as alt bottle? no, has NBT (id:minecraft:potion,tag:{Potion:minecraft:water})
 - new item: salmon as harder cod? (old bingo fish was 82%, cod is 50%, salmon is 21%, that is probably too hard)
 
 - end gateway with perm age as way to beacon without beacon
		execute @e[name=Floaty,tag=Zam_Beam] ~ ~ ~ setblock ~ ~ ~ end_gateway 0 {Age:100}
		(repeat) execute @e[name=Floaty,tag=Zam_Beam] ~ ~ ~ blockdata ~ ~ ~ {Age:100}
   the @e is too expensive to run every tick just for a slightly better visual

 - suggested to fill map update room head with water IFF player's head is in water at moment of teleport :P  
        there are other exploits (e.g. in multiplayer, if skeleton shoots at you, drop map and arrow sails by), don't try to fix them all
