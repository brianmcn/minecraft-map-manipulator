MOJANG BUGS

beacon at spawn sometimes not render
absorbtion/HB hearts sometimes not show (client reset 4ixes)
teleporter does not work in SMP, got glitched into bedrock.  figure that out.  (maybe now fixed? i also tp one block higher now)


TEST

to test
uhc balance; made lots of changes to food/heals/start items/spawners
made some changes to cave-side-paths, see if ok... they are decent, main issue is still that not always at dead ends, due to imperfect skeleton
test new food balance
test new flat set piece...
test SMP lighting
test if teleporters get discovered (barely so far, now tried making farther and less spread out marks)
test if peaks (hmDiffPerCC value) look ok
test new STRUCTURE_SPACING to spread out peaks/flats (flats not as flat, also overlap problems uncovered)...
test the potion buffs (speed is good, strength good, haste didn't notice much, health boost good when not glitch display)
test SMP loot balance
SMP testing is super-useful!
cobweb flat would make good screenshot, half slice of hollowed-out mountain (if I ever make that)
playtest note: Fixxxer didn't use silk touch for feesh->cobble, nor think of picking up enderchest with it
playtest note: Fixxxer didn't think to mine cobble walls of dungeon
playtest note: Fixxxer went for red before green (forgot book info), got close
playtest note: can cheat the day/night boundary in SMP (but no known fix)
playtest note: Fix and I completed red after 3.2 hours; (another red and) mountain after 4.7 hours, whole map after 6 hours (did purple before secret)
playtest note: Fix & I did a second red, got more loot, was much easier 2nd time (better gear)
playtest note: Fix missed 2 desert chests before seeing one, missed a tree chest before seeing one
playtest note: Fix rarely read the name of chests the first time
playtest note: Fix found teleporter only after all monument blocks and flying elytra
playtest note: Obe used elytra to zoom in & out of 2nd mountain peak for extra loot.  i don't mind.
playtest note: Obe finished in 14 hours (6 hours on camera, 8 farming, exploring, etc) with 13 deaths
playtest note: both obe & fix kinda wanted to replay and speedrun afterwards :)
playtest note: obe used mob-drop gear even to attack mountain, did little anvil/enchant before then
get use to clicking for invincibility frames, think about mob balance with viable spam clicking\

TODO: bugs & good ideas

ideas for 'harder' mobs: armored, carrying sharp weapons, having regen/strength, knockback resistance, ...

ds could be use4ul 4or outrunning mobs across river; like fw, hard to encourage enough tho... and exclusive to each other, hm
consider directly give some fw2 boots with other good something, to make more likely to use? no, has downsides too (waterfalls, farms, ...), hm
FW works with mobs, can use that somehow? summon Skeleton ~ ~ ~1 {ArmorItems:[{id:iron_boots,tag:{ench:[{id:9s,lvl:1s}]}}]}  replaceitem any near the thingy?

even a tiny floating island of like 40 blocks with one tree and a waterfall can be a fun little set piece (with a loot chest)
 - have a crude mockup in 126finished.
noisemaker noteblock troll underground? fireworks spawner... that has a secret loot chest (or cmd block with red block above chest, break block turns off repeat cmd)
something with netherrack fires?
deal with "// TODO these probabilities can cause wild swings in variance"
a finite set of collectable items could be good long-term for completionists
an area made out of chests/furnaces/etc where you want to use your bow is a nice 'trap' as right-clicking opens the chest

one-way-home teleport mechanic? something time consuming you can't use in battle? kill iron golem or something? hm... or maybe one-way TPs home at major dungeon chests?
final book TODOs, some kind of better acknowledgement when complete map (fireworks spawner? could appear at ladder top)

LNG https://plus.google.com/b/116398726889585382877/102898606764462175242 said he's interested in beta-testing (but has not played 1.9 before)

elytra rework:
 - Fix had never used elytra before, didn't know how to fly, looked straight down, died of fall damage
 - have a 'how to fly with elytra' book
since dungeons can be done out of order, last book cannot be written to assume it is the last book.
summary and maybe starting book need summary customization info (seed, # player loot, difficulty, ...)
obe loves 'utility' custom items (e.g. digging feesh, glass harvester, eff X pick, ...), also unbreakable/spammable stuff? 'attribute loot', armor with health boost, knockback resist, etc... consider those... also saw "sharpness -4, smite 7" which "can only harm undead"
obe would like to 'continue with normal survival' after done
need to have thank yous to obe/fix, and others who help (codewarrior?)
obe did not know he could walk into black cube of teleporter, thought he needed enderpearl (how to teach? chat text? book?)
possibly have each 'type' of random loot chest have a different collectible, so side-goal of getting all collectibles? (what is 'displayable' to collect? ...)
more variety of random-chest-loot (have some good weapons/armor that will break quickly (e.g. smite V diamond sword with only 50 durability), or other 'collectables'); loot increases with distance from spawn? some traps necessary
(the obeslisks in Eventide were effectively 'set pieces', can I think of others? wide area spawners did wonders for them; witch area (light) or guardian area (no water) may be good too?)
'keep eyes open', can have multiple chest names, vary; same with dead-end, maybe



naming
------
"retro"/"throwback"? seed-ed? roguelike? customized? randomized? play on spelunky/BoI? made-to-order? ___-crafted? rand-crafted, like hand-crafted?
procedural? programmed? custom-built?
alternate-universe? multiplicity? variety? replay?
summon CTM {SpawnerCount:"High",NumPlayers:2,Seed:3456,Language:"English"}
'seed the monument' (beetroots o plant e.g. are a goal?!?)
Mapple cobbler



below this line can probably do without for beta
------------------------------------------------
interesting idea is the 'alternate world'/'dream plane'/etc, where you get TPd to different region of map that's "same but different" a la Zelda:LttP and a couple CTMs
more varied terrain (like the end/hell trees) makes exploring more fun; vanilla is vanilla; mycelium?
some other block substitutions to make things interesting? cobble stairs/double-slabs to feign stone in caves?
 - glowstone 'ore veins' are fun to find (instead of lava? creepers can wreck? ...) idea: CC the lava/flowing_lava, convert all connected to level 10 to glowstone, if y>10, 50% air, if y <=10 obsidian?
 - biome change-up (to change grass colors)? to what purpose? (prefer to have a mechanic)
 - guardian swamp? (would it have treasure? utility item?)
 - some snow biome changeup with snowmen/creeper spawners on surface (some utility item?)
 - forest or ice spikes are good places to 'hide spawners' (trees, spikes) in an area, but how/what to put in middle to find?
 - mushroom biome with no mobs and rainbow color stuff? (lit with glowstone etc?) brown wool troll chest, in a fleecy box? too OP for underground loot? ok if near far egde of map, after caving not useful.
diorite pillars at day/night go down into some caves, was kind a cool effect, other ways to use? circle around some box/chest for another mini set piece?
seemd like there may still be some skylight bugs, do more checks versus MC
***look of dungeons customized, e.g. moss -> netherrack in hell biome, more spawners per dungeon has better loot
spawners inside tree leaves are nice simple 'traps', maybe by the tree chests? (how look on fast graphics if inside? or maybe just top center block of '+' e.g.)
consider language/translation stuff? german/ellpeck? (don't spend too much effort unless clear could be a big payoff)
obe things underground dungeons had too many mobs; fewer but harder might be good (blaze?) ... unsure how I feel (obe wanted more silverfish in final dungeon!)
glass set piece had cave below it, fixer went into it.  set piece was kinda blah
purple beacon dungeon - witches infighting caused a feesh-pocalypse, I nearly died... not sure how to deal with, but un-ideal
awesome trap idea for underground cave (green/purple), spawners at/in lava layer can be almost ignored, what if trap dispenses a water bucket? or just have ice in ceiling or water sources behind spawners, etc
spider jockey spawner above the bedrock of mountain peak was kinda 'useful' (spawned mobs, made reason to go atop), consider intentionally putting stuff above it
still some cave-skeleton bugs (screenshots from jan 20)
***witch zones / guardian zones (could be small zone, but when you stand at loot chest, they spawn?)
***'themed' mobs, e.g. lots of undead, so smite/IH works, etc, make 'gear options' valuable
***configurable difficulty (# spawners, amount of loot, limit good foods, mob stats? map size? local difficulty/inhabitedtime? weather? uhc mode?) (somewhat in-progress already)
spawner underneath dead-end chest?
***hyper-spawner (dispenser with eggs)
***places where gravel floor falls
  - desert trap, can rig sand to fall like 10 blocks to obsidian line hole with a low-range spawner underneath, or have TNT, etc, can find flat areas, preserve cacti, etc.
  - key is getting player to set off trap, need a hook: gold block, chest, etc. and a few of them so not every one is a trap
***skeleton trap, electrified creeper
***primed tnt buried in walls
trap where enderman grabs sand/whatever and update lava somehow (floating lava?)
legendary: seeing x from afar leads to seeing y up close... (telporter path, ...)
have a way to 'go to normal', e.g. turn off world border, (world embedded in normal terrain generator, ores, dungeons, with structures on, 
   small biomes, same seed, seamless?), turn off night stuff, how fix nether? ...
   what about drops after game is over? conditionally change all mob drops back to normal based on scoreboard? or? (like nether, have people delete files?)
glowstone behind stairs in wall (like Eventide Trance) highlights part of cave/dungeon without giving light
TODOs and refactorings...
undergound: 'giant crystal cave', e.g. you go down a cave and find a huge open space with ice and glass and whatnot. (how to generate 'look', how to place so there's a path, how to get player to find)


other ideas
floating structures? lava/water pillars fall down? sky has 'advantage' of being open to build without overlap... eventide trance parkour up the creeper platforms stuff
 - also oceans/tiny islands, can build without overlap, just need ways to draw players out there to find them
could put more than one spawner in wall in green/purple cave as progress... could extinguish lava -> obsidian for less light...
tnt exploding a morse code explosion-sound something?!?
infinite loot chest puzzle (need a certain tree/path through 27 chests in each to win, or something)
hollow out mountain, for top-down, multi-tier, encased in bedrock dungeon? ghast spawner atop mtn when broken could lead to ladder down to hollowed mountain dungeon
desert falling sand could also open hole into giant underground cavern of some sort?
more variants of set pieces (persistence-required mobs placed in map)
  - land guardians may make a good set piece (protection books?)
  - something to protect a good bow? close to spawn? kinda hard to get good bow early
rand cave wall spawners guarding iron/gold blocks?
give stack of zoomed-out, unfilled maps centered at 0,0 at start? zoom level 4 makes even giant bedrock ceiling indistinguishable; level 3 is better but still not great, have to juggle 4 maps, sigh

idea: foresight potion, shows what rare things mobs will drop
  - zombie/skeleton/pigzombie wear item as head armor slot
  - other mobs have a visible customname
to implement it, would have to use commands:
  - select an unprocessed-tag mob, mark to-process
  - deceide whether it gets a rare drop at all (most don't)
  - if so, select a 'kind' (item sans enchants) of rare drop from its table (long list of commands, PRNG to activate one)
  - entitydata/replaceitem the mob to display it; entitydata its DeathLootTable to drop it (loot table could still e.g. apply random enchants)
  - (requires factoring loot tables differently, so 'common' loot is in a separate table, so 'rare' could still reference 'common'; alternatively, could just be 'extra' loot atop normal drops)
