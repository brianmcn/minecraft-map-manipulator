beacon at spawn sometimes not render, villager in hub sometimes not render
absorbtion/HB hearts sometimes not show (client reset 4ixes)
go thru gateway on horse 91628
elytra no work after tp https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-92916

TO TEST

uhc balance; made lots of changes to food/heals/start items/spawners
made some changes to cave-side-paths, see if ok... they are decent, main issue is still that not always at dead ends, due to imperfect skeleton
test if teleporters get discovered (barely so far, now tried making farther and less spread out marks)
test if peaks (hmDiffPerCC value) look ok
test new STRUCTURE_SPACING to spread out peaks/flats (flats not as flat, also overlap problems uncovered)...
test the potion buffs (speed is good, strength good, haste didn't notice much, health boost good when not glitch display)
test SMP loot balance
SMP testing is super-useful!
cobweb flat would make good screenshot, half slice of hollowed-out mountain (if I ever make that)
playtest note: Fixxxer didn't use silk touch for feesh->cobble, nor think of picking up enderchest with it
playtest note: Fixxxer didn't think to mine cobble walls of dungeon
playtest note: Fixxxer went for red before green (forgot book info), got close
playtest note: Fix and I completed red after 3.2 hours; (another red and) mountain after 4.7 hours, whole map after 6 hours (did purple before secret)
playtest note: Fix & I did a second red, got more loot, was much easier 2nd time (better gear)
playtest note: Fix rarely read the name of chests the first time
playtest note: Obe used elytra to zoom in & out of 2nd mountain peak for extra loot.  i don't mind.
playtest note: Obe finished in 14 hours (6 hours on camera, 8 farming, exploring, etc) with 13 deaths
playtest note: both obe & fix kinda wanted to replay and speedrun afterwards :)
playtest note: obe used mob-drop gear even to attack mountain, did little anvil/enchant before then
playtest note: did a play: 1.5 hours to finish green, 1 more for red, 0.5 for peak, 1.5 to finish, quite hard, got 9/12 bonus blocks

COLLECTABLES:

even a tiny floating island of like 40 blocks with one tree and a waterfall can be a fun little set piece (with a loot chest)
 - have a crude mockup in 126finished.  over plains/ice-plains/desert could be good
noisemaker noteblock troll underground? fireworks spawner... that has a secret loot chest (or cmd block with red block above chest, break block turns off repeat cmd)
could even have a block in the starter chest to suggest the hunt
deal with "// TODO these probabilities can cause wild swings in variance"
glowing underground mob? (invul magma?) spell something out, or have arrow, or be above chest, or what? (can't due to https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-97094)
out-of-place lilypads on oceans/lakes?
possibly have each 'type' of random loot chest have a different collectible, so side-goal of getting all collectibles? (what is 'displayable' to collect? ...)
a finite set of collectable items could be good long-term for completionists - lore/blockentitytag so can proc if they get them all? yeah, 16 colors stained glass, can easily testfor a la QFE to proc when 16 points
secrets hidden behind out-of-place-blocks (e.g. chiseled stone, 3x3gravel, etc in walls of caves)
what if each of the 16 colors had a one-word name, and the 16 words spelled out a sentence? or?

CHECKLIST (automate?)
make world checklist:
    tweak customization knobs
	(ensure RCTM world has right ore settings)
	set up world name
	run it
publish checklist: 
	fix icon
	do any manual customization
	run /gamemode 0 /defaultgamemode 0
	remove stats/playerdata
	change folder name map date/name
	make a copy
	go in and check spawn, teleporters, orchid, map_0

TEST
what if enable-command-block=false on server? what fails first? (death counter?) need reminder in book?

TODO: bugs & good ideas

still maybe too much diamonds or prot at end; final a little too short now? maybe 475?
green can be in render dist of spawn (square versus round), change that?
consider second line in lore of hoe to say to dig... and maybe make shovel with column of dirt under flower before glass? or HUD say 'dig here' when at location?
cobblestone/stone brick stairs/slabs may be nice blocks to give (saw paraxis using wood stairs), can also give stone/cobble in chests far from spawn
fix map.dat stuff
break 'kurt special' out into explorer monument plus kurt stuff

there is still an overwhelming amount of book loot; more 'given items' (reduce choice, but also reduce paralysis)
also, give more BoA axes maybe along the way, since so useful throughout? or at least BoA 5, who would ever use 2?

add kurt? cthulhu? ... to testers?

for cthulhu - seed 'mesa2'? other features...? cthulhu stuff (ink?)
food bonus in random chests?  occasional something great makes all chests better (could even have totally different chest every so often, for common ones at least)... xp bottles?
could put time later (local diff) if farther from spawn?

maybe-consider with more feedback:
are there too many webs in the red?


future features/map request:
get rid of all grass/tallgrass?
(possibly some spellbook that lets you pull up all the 'quest text' to refer back to in chat or something, so don't need to carry/forget books?)
cow spawn eggs (too op?) rationing friendly mobs? ...
thunderstorm rather than night outside the ring? https://www.reddit.com/r/VanillaSwirlCTM/comments/4btdb9/map_request_thread/d1xpa0x
plains/flower forest/sunflowers hide chest under weird flower formation
could do like divining rod, but with voronoi and find nearest but only if within a certain radius or something... 
 - could even only track the colors you've not got yet? beeping frequency/tone suggest when getting close, but not direction/exact? 
   but also need scoreboard way to track which colors found and placed in monument...
   consider different implementation strategeis, e.g. again blocks underground versus entities at chests, really think thru trade-offs
 - with entity at chest, could track stat.trappedChestTriggered, when increase, note nearest marker entity within 6 blocks or so (system will trigger and fail a lot when opening storage chests at spawn)
   also maybe execute-detect for chest of any marker entity that wants to beep
 - or maybe use the monument chest as the source of truth, when player holds the sensor, check the chest for empty slots to know colors missing, and only beep those entities
    - will still beep chest looted but item lost/not returned; this desync is part of core issue... maybe also E-D for the loot? probably, since e.g.
	  on a finding mission after getting one you want to keep searching for another but not have this one still ping? though other same color would ping until return to monument...
any kind of 'progress meter' in cave dungeons? 
what if in purple dungeon, first 5 spawners are zombie, next 5 are skeleton, creeper, cave spider, wither skel, witch, and then mix after that?
bats with a trail of fire particles look cool :)
something with pushable blocks or moving platforms using shulkers?


post to /r/minecraftmaps, /r/ctm, forum?

consider TNT under one loot chest nearest spawn? then need no more traps :)
ideas for 'harder' mobs: armored, thorns, carrying sharp weapons, wither skellies, flame bow skellies (or jockeys), having regen/strength, knockback resistance, increased follow distance, (do fire spiders inflict onFire?)... wither skellies with bows (shoot fire arrows: /summon Skeleton ~ ~ ~ {SkeletonType:1b,HandItems:[{id:"minecraft:bow"}]})
 - mobs that spawn at diff light levels/conditions (e.g. riding invisible silversifh with 0.5 health and withered)


more underground flora (ferns, flowers, etc) are usually fun... underground grass? ...

ender crystals?
herobrine? something with armor stands?
guardian area in Monument.dat apparently spawns _only_ guardians, so could make a (waterless) no-spawn-hostiles without changing biome? (though that's not what I saw in nafandix)
soulsand (over ice?) as challenging terrain/substiution somewhere? v podzol in mega taiga? ...

one-way-home teleport mechanic? something time consuming you can't use in battle? kill iron golem or something? hm... or maybe one-way TPs home at major dungeon chests?

obe loves 'utility' custom items (e.g. digging feesh, glass harvester, eff X pick, ...), also unbreakable/spammable stuff (unbreakable leather/gold armor could be useful early and not OP)? 'attribute loot', armor with health boost, knockback resist, etc... consider those... also saw "sharpness -4, smite 7" which "can only harm undead"
obe would like to 'continue with normal survival' after done
obe did not know he could walk into black cube of teleporter, thought he needed enderpearl (how to teach? chat text? book?)
more variety of random-chest-loot (have some good weapons/armor that will break quickly (e.g. smite V diamond sword with only 50 durability), or other 'collectables'); loot increases with distance from spawn? some traps necessary
 - unrepairable: you can set the RepairCost to a high value (though will also prevent any other usage with an anvil): /give @p minecraft:diamond_shovel 1 40 {display:{Name:"Custom Tool"},RepairCost:1000}
(the obeslisks in Eventide were effectively 'set pieces', can I think of others? wide area spawners did wonders for them; witch area (light) or guardian area (no water) may be good too?)
empty chest (with a name?) can be good troll
snow layers could be an interesting aesthetic or terrain feature?
treasure maps (actual maps) are neat, a la https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMhSt75or2U&t=9m45s or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae2YKOAHtZY&t=1m55s (savanna flat grass, ring of lilypads (on ocean?)) but how make area recognizable/findable? CTM sub-area is smaller, find map in area... for me?
	another (missing tall grass/flowers for X): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbtlLfEDsFk&t=9m
end dimension with other biomes allows other things to spawn (useful for lighting? no beds, bedrock fire, has water, lava speed?, what other mechanics in end dimension?)
when I do start adding any 'structures', they should all have randomness too (e.g. saw a cool big 'candle' whose fire was floating lava blocks, that could be neat to proc generate; more 'organic' stuff)
what about a mob that can place blocks? like leaves a trail of obsidian as it walks, maybe blocking you in? or something?
throwable light source (a la arcane bomb, splash pot -> tnt -> fire) is cool; arrows with pot effects for limited ammo special ranged something
rather than paintings, custom maps/design/info on walls, maybe with traps or secrets behind them


below this line can probably do without for beta
------------------------------------------------
'keep eyes open', can have multiple chest names, vary; same with dead-end, maybe

cool proc: walking on path blocks grants a speed buff
weapon with very long cooldown but very strong (e.g. one hit at start of battle?)
a really useful proc would be temp throwable light, e.g. arrow that lights fire where it lands, or puts temp light there somehow, hm... need an air block to replace of course... ghast fireball with limited explosion?
item that when held or worn grants night vision? or trigger command can type, keep score how many you have left? thunder and then world bright for 5-10s?
can give effects when in water (execute detect) or lava
can have in-ground arrows or in-flight arrows have area effects (brief fire?)
interesting idea is the 'alternate world'/'dream plane'/etc, where you get TPd to different region of map that's "same but different" a la Zelda:LttP and a couple CTMs
more varied terrain (like the end/hell trees) makes exploring more fun; vanilla is vanilla; mycelium?
can have forest -> ice forest, with leaves as packed ice, and have snow golem spawners (which will interact naturally with creepers on occasion)
some other block substitutions to make things interesting? cobble stairs/double-slabs to feign stone in caves?
 - glowstone 'ore veins' are fun to find (instead of lava? creepers can wreck? ...) idea: CC the lava/flowing_lava, convert all connected to level 10 to glowstone, if y>10, 50% air, if y <=10 obsidian?
 - biome change-up (to change grass colors)? to what purpose? (prefer to have a mechanic)
 - guardian swamp? (would it have treasure? utility item?)
 - some snow biome changeup with snowmen/creeper spawners on surface (some utility item?)
 - forest or ice spikes are good places to 'hide spawners' (trees, spikes) in an area, but how/what to put in middle to find?
 - mushroom biome with no mobs and rainbow color stuff? (lit with glowstone etc?) brown wool troll chest, in a fleecy box? too OP for underground loot? ok if near far egde of map, after caving not useful.
 - colored banners to decore an area and make it feel like it has a theme, or to mark a location, or something...
diorite pillars at day/night go down into some caves, was kind a cool effect, other ways to use? circle around some box/chest for another mini set piece?
seemd like there may still be some skylight bugs, do more checks versus MC
***look of dungeons customized, e.g. moss -> netherrack in hell biome, more spawners per dungeon has better loot
spawners inside tree leaves are nice simple 'traps', maybe by the tree chests? (how look on fast graphics if inside? or maybe just top center block of '+' e.g.)
consider language/translation stuff? german/ellpeck? (don't spend too much effort unless clear could be a big payoff)
obe things underground dungeons had too many mobs; fewer but harder might be good (blaze?) ... unsure how I feel (obe wanted more silverfish in final dungeon!)
glass set piece had cave below it, fixer went into it.  set piece was kinda blah
purple beacon dungeon - witches infighting caused a feesh-pocalypse, I nearly died... not sure how to deal with, but un-ideal
awesome trap idea for underground cave (green/purple), spawners at/in lava layer can be almost ignored, what if trap dispenses a water bucket? or just have ice in ceiling or water sources behind spawners, etc
spider jockey spawner above the bedrock of mountain peak was kinda 'useful' (spawned mobs, made reason to go atop), consider intentionally putting stuff above it
still some cave-skeleton bugs (screenshots from jan 20)
***witch zones / guardian zones (could be small zone, but when you stand at loot chest, they spawn?)
***'themed' mobs, e.g. lots of undead, so smite/IH works, etc, make 'gear options' valuable
***configurable difficulty (# spawners, amount of loot, limit good foods, mob stats? map size? local difficulty/inhabitedtime? weather? uhc mode?) (somewhat in-progress already)
spawner underneath dead-end chest?
***hyper-spawner (dispenser with eggs)
***places where gravel floor falls
  - desert trap, can rig sand to fall like 10 blocks to obsidian line hole with a low-range spawner underneath, or have TNT, etc, can find flat areas, preserve cacti, etc.
  - key is getting player to set off trap, need a hook: gold block, chest, etc. and a few of them so not every one is a trap
***skeleton trap, electrified creeper
***primed tnt buried in walls
trap where enderman grabs sand/whatever and update lava somehow (floating lava?)
an area made out of chests/furnaces/etc where you want to use your bow is a nice 'trap' as right-clicking opens the chest
trap where lava encased in wood/leaves etc with no air space to start fire, once player breaks blocks, fire may ignite (tnt?)
anvils sitting on decaying leaf blocks in the sky?
legendary: seeing x from afar leads to seeing y up close... (telporter path, ...)
(secret rooms behind walls that look solid (e.g. array of armor stand with hardened clay on head looks like wall))
have a way to 'go to normal', e.g. turn off world border, (world embedded in normal terrain generator, ores, dungeons, with structures on, 
   small biomes, same seed, seamless?), turn off night stuff, how fix nether? ...
   what about drops after game is over? conditionally change all mob drops back to normal based on scoreboard? or? (like nether, have people delete files?)
glowstone behind stairs in wall (like Eventide Trance) highlights part of cave/dungeon without giving light
TODOs and refactorings...
undergound: 'giant crystal cave', e.g. you go down a cave and find a huge open space with ice and glass and whatnot. (how to generate 'look', how to place so there's a path, how to get player to find)
special named chickens that lay emeralds or something: https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/46vf81/diamondlaying_chickens/
interesting 'proc's
surface (or underground) structures are fun to find, even if just small rare not-too-useful item, nice to 'see new stuff' that looks interesting (but requires 'builds')

other ideas
floating structures? lava/water pillars fall down? sky has 'advantage' of being open to build without overlap... eventide trance parkour up the creeper platforms stuff
 - also oceans/tiny islands, can build without overlap, just need ways to draw players out there to find them
could put more than one spawner in wall in green/purple cave as progress... could extinguish lava -> obsidian for less light...
tnt exploding a morse code explosion-sound something?!?
infinite loot chest puzzle (need a certain tree/path through 27 chests in each to win, or something)
hollow out mountain, for top-down, multi-tier, encased in bedrock dungeon? ghast spawner atop mtn when broken could lead to ladder down to hollowed mountain dungeon
desert falling sand could also open hole into giant underground cavern of some sort?
more variants of set pieces (persistence-required mobs placed in map)
  - land guardians may make a good set piece (protection books?)
  - something to protect a good bow? close to spawn? kinda hard to get good bow early
rand cave wall spawners guarding iron/gold blocks?
give stack of zoomed-out, unfilled maps centered at 0,0 at start? zoom level 4 makes even giant bedrock ceiling indistinguishable; level 3 is better but still not great, have to juggle 4 maps, sigh

idea: foresight potion, shows what rare things mobs will drop
  - zombie/skeleton/pigzombie wear item as head armor slot
  - other mobs have a visible customname
to implement it, would have to use commands:
  - select an unprocessed-tag mob, mark to-process
  - deceide whether it gets a rare drop at all (most don't)
  - if so, select a 'kind' (item sans enchants) of rare drop from its table (long list of commands, PRNG to activate one)
  - entitydata/replaceitem the mob to display it; entitydata its DeathLootTable to drop it (loot table could still e.g. apply random enchants)
  - (requires factoring loot tables differently, so 'common' loot is in a separate table, so 'rare' could still reference 'common'; alternatively, could just be 'extra' loot atop normal drops)

idea: five lives: each time you die, your default max hearts decreases 2 (discourage suicide in UHC mode)
/summon ThrownPotion ~ ~2 ~ {Potion:{id:"splash_potion",Count:1b,tag:{CustomPotionEffects:[{Id:21b,Amplifier:-2b,Duration:1000}]}}}
-2 -3 -4 -5 valid amplifiers for 8 6 4 2 hearts
but the drinkable health pot would override completely... might be nice to 'buy back' hearts at a time, dunno, kinda tedious...
overall, not too compelling; those who would avoid suicide don't need the extra challenge, they'll challenge selves; just creating busy work for those who would suicide
